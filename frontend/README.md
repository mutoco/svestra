# Svestra frontend

This setup is based on [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and Webpack and includes a lot of examples and settings to use it together with a [Strapi backend](https://github.com/mutoco/svestra/tree/master/backend).

## Getting started

Open your terminal, navigate to this folder and type:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Examples & features

- Page prefetching
- SCSS Support + some helpers & mixins
- API-Example for GraphQL and REST [(/routes/articles)](https://github.com/mutoco/svestra/tree/master/frontend/src/routes/articles)
- Example home page:`/`
- Example about page:`/about`
- Example articles page:`/articles` (fetching from corresponding Strapi content-type)
- Example of single article page:`/articles/:Slug` (fetching from corresponding Strapi article slug)
- Login-screen if user is not authenticated (and therefore not allowed to read API)
