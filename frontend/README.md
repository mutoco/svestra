# Svestra frontend

This setup is based on [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and Webpack and includes a lot of examples and settings to use it together with a [Strapi backend](https://github.com/mutoco/svestra/tree/master/backend).

## Getting started

Open your terminal, navigate to this folder and type:

```bash
npm install
```

Before starting your frontend-server, make sure to create an `.env` file in
your frontend folder. You can use the provided `.env.example` for that.

Then run `npm run dev` to start your frontend server.

### Authentication

We don't want, that our Strapi API is publicly available. That's why you'll see a login screen first if you run this Sapper application. If you are using Strapi with our database dump, you can use the Editors credentials to login in on the frontend side. Make sure you checkout the [Svestra backend README.](https://github.com/mutoco/svestra/tree/master/backend)

## Examples & features

- Page prefetching
- SCSS Support + some helpers & mixins
- API-Example for GraphQL and REST [(/routes/articles)](https://github.com/mutoco/svestra/tree/master/frontend/src/routes/articles)
- Example home page:`/` (fetching from corresponding Strapi single type)
- Example about page:`/about` (fetching from corresponding Strapi single type)
- Example articles page:`/articles` (fetching from corresponding Strapi collection type)
- Example of single article page:`/articles/:Slug` (fetching from corresponding Strapi article slug)
- Login-check (/src/_helpers) if user is not authenticated (and therefore not allowed to read API)
- Strapi-fetching helpers (/src/_helpers)

## Good to know & troubleshooting
- We are using Strapis draft system together with `.env` variables to show drafts and published stuff on staging, but only published things on the live site. Can be seen in `/routes/articles/[slug].json.js` 
- Note that we use lowercase keys in Strapi for fields of single- and collection content-types e.g `title`. On the other side, we use capitalized keys like `Title` for components. The current version of Strapi (3.2.3) fails if you combine components with content-type that have the same key. Make sure you take care of this difference in your frontend application.
- All markdown fields with the suffix `_md` will be parsed automatically using a helper (src/_helpers/parse-markdown.js)
- ðŸš§ TODO: Will add more documentation soon. In the meantime, please be vocal over on the [Sapper issue tracker](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues).

## Deployment

- ðŸš§ TODO: Instructions will be added soon. We think of a staging and a production environment based on `.env` variables. In the meantime, checkout [Sappers deployment guide.](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Deployment)

## Strapi Backend

Make sure you check out the corresponding [Svestra backend](https://github.com/mutoco/svestra/tree/master/backend) for more information about the backend side.
